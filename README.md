Aspen Casted Divination with Poor Rustle and saw a battle where Nepe and Balazar almost Die. 

Based on the vision we're going to appeal to Selune to help us with the upcoming battle. 

We see Slaad Tracks into Thandolin.  Then they turn into regular tracks size of regular men into town.  
We check with Tolbin at the Stonhill in regarding the strangers.  He mentions Harbon left and came back.  
He is a Slaad

Outisde in Harbon Westors shed, he returns to slaad form.
Casted Fireball on the Slaad and destroy the slaad. 

Killed the Gray, Red and Death Slaad in Thandolin

We have a long Rest after the battle

Town is missing the tavern boy.  

We take off to Silver Moon to see if we can talk/commune with Selune.
